# Go Mummy!

With fond memories of Amsoft's Oh Mummy, and being a Spectrum boy myself, I
decided it was high time to bring Oh Mummy to the Spectrum via NextBASIC in the
form of "Go Mummy!"

## The story

Back in 1984 a party of archaeologist went on search for lost treasures, and yet
they found themselves simply crying _"Oh Mummy!"_.

In the modern day, you're tasked with the job of rescuing the archaeologists
from their failed pyramid plundering.

u must navigate five catacombs, avoiding the guardians, rescue those muppets and
bring them back to Blighty. Surround the tombs to find the archaeologist and key
to escape their contents.

And remember: DON'T GET CHOMPED!
