# Go Mummy!

With fond memories of Amsoft's Oh Mummy, and being a Spectrum boy myself, I
decided it was high time to bring Oh Mummy to the Spectrum via NextBASIC in the
form of "Go Mummy!"

## The story

Back in 1984 a party of archaeologist went on search for lost treasures, and yet
they found themselves simply crying _"Oh Mummy!"_.

In the modern day, you're tasked with the job of rescuing the archaeologists
from their failed pyramid plundering.

You must navigate five catacombs, avoiding the guardians, rescue those muppets
and bring them back to Blighty. Surround the tombs to find the archaeologist and
key to escape their contents.

And remember: DON'T GET CHOMPED!

## Game play

Surround the tombs to reveal the contents. To completely crack one edge of the
tomb, you must run from one intersection to the next which will cause the side
to crack.

You must leave the catacomb the way that you entered, and you cannot leave until
you have *both* the archaeologist and the key.

Although it's not required to reveal every tomb, you'll earn points doing so.

## Scoring

You gain points for:

- Revealing an empty tomb: 1 point
- Reveal gold: 5 points
- Kill a guardian: 10 points
- Finding the archaeologist: 25 points
- Finding the key: 25 points
- Exit a level: 50 points

The speed and difficulty selected affects the score by multiples.

Easiest speed and difficultly has a base multiple of 1.

Fastest speed and hardest difficult has a base multiple of 5.

Want to beat the high score? Go hard and fast!
